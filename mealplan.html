    That's it! You should be feeling full of energy and not even hungry for about 4 hours!
    And, you won't have a normal crash typically associated with coffee.

  <h2> Butter Coffee or Tea </h2>
  <p> 1. Brew two cups of your favorite Coffee or Tea. <br>
      2. Pour into a blender <br>
      3. Add 2 tbsp of grass fed butter to the blender <br>
      4. Add 1 tbsp of MCT Oil to the blender <br>
      5. Blend it up for about 20 seconds and you're ready to go! <br>
      *Note: Play around with the amount of MCT Oil--I recommend
      starting small and building up to around 1-1.5 tbsp
