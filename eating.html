  <p> <a href = "http://www.ketogenic-diet-resource.com/support-files/kd-basics.pdf">Here</a> is a really good resource for what to eat on the ketogenic diet. It also walks you through the steps of figuring out how much
  you need to be eating each day. I highly recommend checking it out and referring back to it as much as you need.
  This app called KetoDiet also has a ton of recipes and is really helpful when it comes to figuring out what to eat or if you can eat something.
  And, well, if you just want to see what I did, keep reading on my friend.

  <h2>My Tips</h2>
  <p>

  </p>

  <h2>Breakfast</h2>
  <ul>
  <li><a href = "#Butter Coffee"> Butter Coffee or Tea</a> <li>
    That's it! Have this every morning and you should be feeling full of energy and not even hungry for about 4 hours!
    Plus, you won't feel jittery or experience the normal crash you typically get with coffee.

  <h1> Butter Coffee or Tea </h1>
  <p> 1. Brew two cups of your favorite Coffee or Tea. <br>
      2. Pour into a blender <br>
      3. Add 2 tbsp of grass fed butter to the blender <br>

      *Note: Play around with the amount of MCT Oil--I recommend
      starting small and building up to around 1-1.5 tbsp
