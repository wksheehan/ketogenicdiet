  <p> <a href = "http://www.ketogenic-diet-resource.com/support-files/kd-basics.pdf">Here</a> is a really good resource for what to eat on the ketogenic diet. It also walks you through the steps of figuring out how much
  you need to be eating each day. I highly recommend checking it out and referring back to it as much as you need.
  This app called KetoDiet also has a ton of recipes and is really helpful when it comes to figuring out what to eat or if you can eat something.
  And, well, if you just want to see what I did, keep reading on my friend.

  <h2>My Tips</h2>
  <p>
    -The bottom line is, you can’t have carbs. And carbs are in basically EVERYTHING. So be careful.<br>
    -Following that, learn how to read nutritional information. Look at calories from fat and how many grams of carbohydrates there are. These are bad. <br>
    -Get a calorie counter like My Fitness Pal. Not only will you be able to track how much you are eating each day, but it will break down your macronutrient ratio and other helpful stuff like that.<br>
    -Avocado goes well with just about every meal, and they have tons of good fat and essential nutrients. I eat about two a day. If you don’t like avocado, well...that sucks.<br>
    -Nuts and cheese are good to snack on throughout the day, if you get hungry or just if you are trying to pack in more calories.<br>
    -Don’t eat too much protein. It can kick you out ketosis if you have too much, just like carbs.<br>
    -Drink plenty of water. I mean it. And make sure you’re getting enough electrolytes, through food or supplements. Otherwise you’ll just pee out all the water and dehydrate yourself.<br>
    -When buying stuff like ranch dressing or certain meats, always look for the fatty versions<br>
    -Don’t be afraid to eat out. It may be a little stressful at first but don’t hesitate to be that annoying person who completely changes what is on the menu (swap olive oil for ranch, add bacon, no tomatoes, etc)
  </p>

  <h2> What to Eat:</h2>
  <p>
    If it’s got a lot of fat in it, go for it. Shoot for things with under 5 grams of carbs, the lower the better.
    I usually look for stuff with the majority of calories from fat and the rest from protein.
    Authority nutrition says to base your meals around these ingredients, and after my experience I totally agree: <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Fatty meat</li>
      <li>Grass fed butter</li>
      <li>Eggs</li>
      <li>Avocados (don’t worry about the carbs in this, they are all from fiber)</li>
      <li>Nuts</li>
      <li>Healthy, fatty oils</li>
      <li>Low carb veggies, cooked in fat</li>
      <li>Cheese</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2> What Not to Eat:</h2>
  <p>
    Carbs, duh. This means sugar, too. Sugar is a carb. Hate to break it to ya, but yeah. So that means…<br>
    <ul>
      <li>All things sugary. Sodas, candy, smoothies, dessert</li>
      <li>Italian food (sorry!). Pasta, bread, gluten in general...all carbs.</li>
      <li>Rice is a carb. Fried foods are carbs. Stay away.</li>
      <li>Potatoes and beans have carbs, too. In case you didn’t know. Don’t eat em.</li>
      <li>Cereal. If this made you sad...you actually eat cereal in the first place? Come on. I know it’s good, but it’s so bad for you.</li>
      <li>Fruit is pretty much a no go, although maybe some berries for dessert in very small quantities</li>
      <li>Stuff labeled “low fat” </li>
      <li>"Sugar free" stuff</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Breakfast</h2>
  <ul>
  <li><a href = "#Butter Coffee"> Butter Coffee or Tea</a> <li>
  <li>That's it! Have this every morning and you should be feeling full of energy and not even hungry for about 4 hours!
    Plus, you won't feel jittery or experience the normal crash you typically get with coffee.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Dinner</h2>

  <h1> Butter Coffee or Tea </h1>
  <p> 1. Brew two cups of your favorite Coffee or Tea. <br>

      starting small and building up to around 1-1.5 tbsp
