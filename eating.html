  <p> <a href = "http://www.ketogenic-diet-resource.com/support-files/kd-basics.pdf">Here</a> is a really good resource for what to eat on the ketogenic diet. It also walks you through the steps of figuring out how much
  you need to be eating each day. I highly recommend checking it out and referring back to it as much as you need.
  This app called KetoDiet also has a ton of recipes and is really helpful when it comes to figuring out what to eat or if you can eat something.
  And, well, if you just want to see what I did, keep reading on my friend.
  </p>

  <h2>My Tips</h2>
  <p>
    -The bottom line is, you can’t have carbs. And carbs are in basically EVERYTHING. So be careful.<br>
    -Following that, learn how to read nutritional information. Look at things like calories from fat and grams of carbohydrates. Keeping track of your macronutrients is an important part of keto. <br>
    -Get a calorie counter like My Fitness Pal. Not only will you be able to track how much you are eating each day, but it will break down your macronutrient ratio and other helpful stuff like that.<br>
    -Avocado goes well with just about every meal, and they have tons of good fat and essential nutrients. I eat about two a day. If you don’t like avocado, well...that sucks.<br>
    -Nuts and cheese are good to snack on throughout the day, if you get hungry or just if you are trying to pack in more calories.<br>
    -Don’t eat too much protein. It can kick you out ketosis if you have too much, just like carbs.<br>
    -Drink plenty of water. I mean it. And make sure you’re getting enough electrolytes, through food or supplements.
     Otherwise you’ll just pee out all the water and dehydrate yourself. I add salt to just about everything.<br>
    -When buying stuff like ranch dressing or certain meats, always look for the fatty versions<br>
    -You're going to crave some crunchy stuff. Things like carrots, celery, bacon, and pickles can all help with that<br>
    -Don’t be afraid to eat out. It may be a little stressful at first but don’t hesitate to be that annoying person who completely changes what is on the menu (swap olive oil for ranch, add bacon, no tomatoes, etc)
  </p>

  <h2> What to Eat:</h2>
  <p>
    If it’s got a lot of fat in it, go for it. Shoot for things with under 5 grams of carbs, the lower the better.
    I usually look for stuff with the majority of calories from fat and the rest from protein.
    Authority nutrition says to base your meals around these ingredients, and after my experience I totally agree: <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Fatty meat</li>
      <li>Grass fed butter</li>
      <li>Eggs</li>
      <li>Avocados (don’t worry about the carbs in this, they are all from fiber)</li>
      <li>Nuts</li>
      <li>Healthy, fatty oils</li>
      <li>Low carb veggies, cooked in fat</li>
      <li>Cheese</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2> What Not to Eat:</h2>
  <p>
    Carbs, duh. This means sugar, too. Sugar is a carb. Hate to break it to ya. So that means…<br>
    <ul>
      <li>All things sugary. Sodas, candy, smoothies, dessert</li>
      <li>Italian food (sorry!). Pasta, bread, gluten in general...all carbs.</li>
      <li>Rice is a carb. Fried foods are carbs. Stay away.</li>
      <li>Potatoes and beans have carbs, too. In case you didn’t know. Don’t eat em.</li>
      <li>Cereal. If this made you sad...you actually eat cereal in the first place? Come on. I know it’s good, but it’s so bad for you.</li>
      <li>Fruit is pretty much a no go, although maybe some berries for dessert in very small quantities</li>
      <li>Stuff labeled “low fat” </li>
      <li>"Sugar free" stuff</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h1>Example Meal Guide</h1>
  <p>
    This is pretty much what I ate and when I ate it. A typical day for me would consist of one bullet point from each meal
    (breakfast, lunch, dinner) with a couple snacks thrown in there. I probably made “dessert” three times over two weeks.
    Feel free to pick and choose what sounds good, move things around, and change it up a little.
    This is just an example of what a meal plan could look like, but what you eat is totally customizable and up to you.
  </p>

  <h2>Breakfast</h2>
  <ul>
  <li><a href = "#Butter Coffee"> Butter Coffee or Tea</a> </li>
  <li>That's it! Have this every morning and you should be feeling full of energy and not even hungry for about 4 hours!
    Plus, you won't feel jittery or experience the normal crash you typically get with coffee.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Lunch</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Eggs, avocado, and either bacon, salmon, sausage, sardines or some form of fatty meat.
        Cook the eggs in about a tablespoon of butter or coconut oil. Make sure to add plenty of salt.</li>
    <li>Lettuce Wrap with cheese, add bacon, avocado, and mayonaisse. Pickles, too, if you like em!</li>
    <li>Fajita beef (or chicken) with lots of guacamole, sour cream, and cheese</li>
    <li>Different kinds of omelets--use veggies, mushrooms, cheese, and meat. Yum!</li>
    <li>You can always add something from the snack list to boost the calories, like nuts</li>
    <li>These are what I usually ate, and didn’t get bored of it after two weeks.
        It’s really easy to find other creative ideas on Google or the KetoDiet app if you’re looking for more variety</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Dinner</h2>
  <p> Salad with feta cheese, olive oil, avocado, and fatty chicken </p>

  <h1> Butter Coffee or Tea </h1>
  <p> 1. Brew two cups of your favorite Coffee or Tea. <br>
      2. Pour into a blender <br>
      3. Add 2 tbsp of grass fed butter to the blender <br>

      starting small and building up to around 1-1.5 tbsp
