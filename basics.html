  <h1> What is Keto?</h1>
  <p> Simply put, the Ketogenic Diet is a low carb, high fat diet with tons of benefits.
    It requires severely cutting back on eating carbohydrates and replacing those calories with fats,
    like butter or avocado. Considering how many carbs are normally consumed in a typical Western Diet,
    this is a huge change. Think about all the stuff you normally eat: cereal, bagels, pasta, pizza,
    hamburgers, french fries, sandwiches, chips, energy bars, ice cream, soda, cookies, mac and cheese,
    Chick-Fil-A, Canes,...The list is endless, and full of carbs.</p>
  <p>
    In fact, the typical American diet not only has a high carbohydrate intake, but also tries to limit
    your fat intake! So if carbs make up most of our life already, why completely abandon all we know and
    instead start eating the opposite way? Isn’t fat bad for you? Fat makes you fat, right? Wrong. By eating
    more fat, you will actually have less of it. The lack of carbohydrates on the Ketogenic diet puts your body
    in a metabolic state known as nutritional ketosis. In this state, your body will start burning fat as energy,
    instead of glucose (carbs). Crazy, right? But it’s totally safe--the Ketogenic Diet is probably the best and
    healthiest diet out there for your body. And that’s not all...

  <h1>Why Would Anyone Want to do This?</h1>
  <p>Hands down, the Ketogenic Diet can help you lose weight. Mr. Wright, my physics teacher, lost said he lost 10 pounds in the period of one month, just from eating differently. Trey Gillespie, a student here at St. Andrew’s, lost 20 pounds in three weeks. And the weight you’re shedding is actually fat, so your body will go through some recomposition and you will come out of it looking leaner than ever. So if weight loss is your end goal, look no further. But if you aren't trying to lose weight (like me), it actually has other awesome benefits too. For one, you won’t be as hungry. And while I don’t need to lose weight, I sure am freaking hungry all the time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Overall, the Ketogenic Diet is going to improve your health. This is because it will prevent you from gaining weight and or help you lose excess weight you already have. But it will also lower your blood sugar and insulin levels. When these are high, they can result in a lot of long term, dangerous health issues. The Ketogenic diet has actually been shown to not only prevent but even treat the following health conditions: cancer, diabetes, heart disease, autism, aging, and more. Wait, did you say aging? Cancer? What??? Yeah, I know right.
  </p>
  <p>
    We all know sugar is bad for you. After about two weeks on this diet, all sugar cravings will pretty much be gone. You will have much more control over what you eat and as a result you’ll feel damn good about yourself, especially if you normally have trouble staying away from unhealthy foods and drinks. You’ll also have control over your hunger. Even when you are hungry, it’s not a painful sharp feeling and you can’t function until you do...it’s more like a dull, deep feeling saying, “oh, I should eat, but we can keep using energy at the same level if you don’t want to!”
  </p>
  <p>
    You’ll have a lot more energy. Fats are a much more efficient energy source than carbs are, and when your body gets adapted to your new diet, you’ll be able to work like a beast. You won’t get sugar crashes, or even tired in general. You have a whole lot more energy and feel very even-keel throughout the entire day. On top of that, you’ll be more clear minded. Especially if you normally mentally feel kind of “foggy” on your normal diet, you should feel a difference. This is great for doing work. Or studying for finals. Or making decisions. Or really anything. Thinking and energy are pretty important. While I haven’t necessarily felt like I can think at a new level on this diet, I for sure can work on stuff at a high level for long periods of time. My focus is also excellent, and I rarely get distracted.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your digestion will be a lot better. I never get stomach cramps or feel bloated on keto. I never feel like I need to take a nap because I just ate so much. Eating is really satisfying and doesn’t sit heavy in your stomach. And honestly, my poops come out super easily.
  </p>
  <p>
    For athletes, keto is really good for low intensity, high endurance activities. Extreme endurance athletes have been experimenting with keto, and I know a lot of them drink butter coffee in the morning. If you’re looking to do some long ass hiking trips or bike rides, keto could definitely be the way to go.
  </p>
  <p>
    There’s also a bunch more sciency stuff that I’m not going to bore you with, but it’s there on the Googles if you want to look it up. One other thing though: apparently keto decreases stiffness and joint pain, but I’m not old enough to notice a difference!

  <h1>How Does This Work?/h1>
  <p>
    Carbohydrates are (normally) our primary source of energy. When you digest sugars and starches (carbohydrates) they get converted into blood sugar, aka glucose. Our body and brain use this glucose as energy. However, since carbohydrates get absorbed really quickly, they supply very quick, high intensity energy while rapidly raising your blood sugar. This can lead to bursts of energy and then crashes, especially if you are eating a lot of “simple” carbohydrates which the body can break down and use the quickest, such as table sugar.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you start restricting your carb intake and up the fat intake, your body switches its metabolic pathways. The fat you start eating will get converted to ketone bodies and used as fuel instead of glucose. Using this fat as energy, instead of carbs, is where all the benefits come from.
  </p>
  <p>
    The reason fats are so awesome is because of their efficiency. One gram of fat converts to  9 calories, whereas carbohydrates are only 4 calories per gram. Calories are essentially energy, so you are literally getting more energy per gram with fats.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fats are so dense that they fill you up faster than carbs would. I could sit down at the table and eat like 1000 calories of pasta in one sitting, and feel full. Or, I could have an avocado, a couple eggs, and some bacon, and feel full. But that second meal would only be around 700 calories! Plus, I would feel the fullness and energy from that meal for a much longer period of time than I would the pasta, because my body is so efficient at using the fats. Something about the ketones make them a “cleaner” fuel for your cells and because of that they can extract more energy than it can from carbs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another important thing about fats vs carbs. The human body can only store about 1000-1600 calories from carbohydrates, whereas we can store hundreds of thousands of calories in the form of fat. Just living a normal day in your life takes up about 2000 calories, so you can see why if we solely relied on carbohydrates this could be problematic. This is why when our bodies are in starvation, our bodies will naturally switch over to using fats as energy in order to preserve our life. The ketogenic diet is basically mimicking this process but supplying external fats to keep it going. However, you could fast for months using fat as energy and live through it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Theoretically, I could keep eating a bunch of refined carbohydrates like cereal all day long and it total up to a ridiculous amount of calories (and I would feel crappy). This is why America has such a problem with obesity. We are able to eat so many carbs and have so much sugar, and then do it all over again two hours later when we get hungry again. With keto, you pretty much eat three meals a day and never feel hungry in between. This is where the weight loss comes in. You literally aren’t as hungry, so you eat less. Less calories means you’re going to lose weight. But you aren’t starving yourself, forcing yourself to eat less. This is the best part. You don’t even think about it, just eat until you are full, and you can watch the pounds slip away.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the athletes, the can probably already figure out how the long endurance stuff works. Carbs get stored as glycogen in the liver and muscles and are called upon when we exercise.
  </p>
  <p>
    I won’t get into all the science behind the cancer and autism and aging, but it’s totally real. For my project, I wasn’t interested in that kind of stuff, although it would be interesting to pursue in the future. For me, I was mainly concerned with the hunger suppressing effects and energy component.

  <h1> So What Do I Do?</h1>
  <p> First off, you gotta eat a ton of fat. About 75-80% of your daily calories should come from fats, 5% from carbs, and the rest from protein. I try not to exceed 20g of carbohydrates a day. Here are some basic guidelines to follow to stay in ketosis:
</p>
  <p> Eat about 1.5 - 2.5 g of fat per kilogram of bodyweight each day.<br>Eat next to no carbs.<br>Eat about 1 - 1.5 g of protein per kilogram of bodyweight.
</p>
  <p> Your total macronutrient breakdown should come out to something close to the percentages above. Ketosis doesn’t work if you eat too much protein, because your body will convert it to glucose and use that as energy.
</p>
  <p>Make sure to drink a ton of water and stay hydrated with electrolytes. Without the carbs getting stored in your liver, it is really easy to get dehydrated.
 </p>
  <p> If you are struggling to get into ketosis, try doing some brisk walking or other form of low-intensity exercise. Exercise definitely helps, and lots of water. You could even fast for a day, but make sure to drink water and electrolytes. You can always add MCT oil to stuff, because that gets quickly converted to ketones for your body to use. It’s the best way to supplement fat.
</p>
  <p>I’m warning you now. It’s going to be hard, but it’s worth it. If this sounded appealing to you when you first read about it, push through that first week. I wanted nothing more those first three days to just chomp down onto a cinnamon roll or have a bowl of cereal. You’ll get through it, and once you do, it’s not bad at all!
