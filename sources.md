[Authority Nutrition](https://authoritynutrition.com/ketogenic-diet-101/) helped a lot with the basics of the Ketogenic Diet

[This Keotgenic Diet Website](http://www.ketogenic-diet-resource.com/ketogenic-diet-plan.html) was my go-to resource for all things Keto

[This](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) is where I got a lot of my HTML help from

[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOXHFvFpimg) how I made the slideshow on my homepage

And, of course, what got me started with this in the first place: the book [Tools of Titans](https://www.amazon.com/Tools-Titans-Billionaires-World-Class-Performers/dp/1328683788) by Tim Ferris. It's really cool and I definitely recommend checking it out, and not just for keto!

Some of the other websites I utilized:
