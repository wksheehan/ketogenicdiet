So this diet is primarily used as an excellent weight loss diet that works with your body instead of against it. The only problem is, I'm already in great shape and if I lost a significant amount of weight that would be an issue. This diet is also really good for preventing things like cancer and heart disease and can slow the aging process. But I'm young and healthy, none of those really matter to me right now. So why am I doing this?

Well, I kind of have this preconception that this diet is going to turn me into a super hero or something. I can already work at a really high level, physically and mentally, and have a ton of energy. So I'm kind of thinking, if I go on a diet where my energy and mental clarity is going to increase, and since I have really good both of those right now, maybe I'll just become an absolute beast!

Also, I'm a sciency kind of guy and am really interested in this kind of stuff. Reasearching how it works and all the benefits it has to your body is not so much a task as it is fun. So I'm kind of thinking about this diet as my own research and testing of the apparent effects it has on people. At the end of the day, I'm just curious.

There are also tons of other nutritional benefits for your body and cells. Plus, the whole point of this diet is that fat makes you really full and stops hunger cravings...for me, this is interesting. If you know me at all, I eat a ton of food. And I mean a TON. So I'm curious to see if this will even satisfy my insatiable appetite in the slightest.

Lastly, I have no cooking experience other than like eggs and sandwhiches. This project will get me in the kitchen more and hopefully I'll learn my way around and some general knowledge about cooking. Heck, I have NO idea where to begin if someone told me to cook them chicken. Do I buy frozen chicken? What pan do I put it in? How long does it need to go in the oven and at what temperature?
