Mental Clarity
==============
Before: I feel good mentally most of the time. However, if I'm ever tired or have a headache or something I definitely feel very "foggy" and can't work on stuff very well.

After: I never really get tired or headaches anymore, so my clarity is very consistently good. However, I would not go so far as to say my best mental clarity moments on keto are better or on a different, higher level than when eating carbs.

Focus
=====
Before: I have pretty good focus but often find myself taking breaks from things or checking my phone.

After: I have excellent focus. The doctor at my well check even noticed when he made me follow the flash light with my eyes. He said, "Wow, you are very focused. All that butter coffee must be working!" When I work on something, I feel like I am able to focus for much longer periods of time and just consistently work at the same level for hours on end, and not really get distracted. Things like driving and playing sports, I don't really notice a difference in the focus aspect.

Energy
======
Before: I'd say for the most part my energy is pretty good, especially compared to other people. Most days though I get really tired between meals, and feel like I'm getting "low blood sugar". I have to eat a lot to keep me going. If I am at school, I get tired by the end of school, go to track practice (takes a ton of energy), and then do all my homework or study for a test. So that's pretty cool. I don't drink coffee and get a lot of sleep. I fall asleep really easily though because by the end of the day, I'm really tired.

After: My energy is awesome and very even keel. I never have highs and lows--I feel about the same throughout the whole day. Hunger is no longer paired with tiredness, as it was before. I am able to do excellent work for long periods of time without getting brain dead. I do drink coffee in the morning, but I went back and forth between decaf and regular and didn't really notice a difference. Overall, I'd say I have more even energy, but before I definitely had big spikes with a ton of energy and then big lows where I just want to take a nap.

Body Measurements
=================
All of my body measurements, like chest, legs, arms, hips, all stayed the same. This was just to make sure I wasn't losing muscle. I also haven't been working out as much as I normally do with track practice and all, so staying at the same measurements was reassuring that this diet wasn't going to eat my muscles up because I didn't have carbs (which totally would never happen).

Weight
=======
Before: I took a couple weight measurements, and averaged about 166 lbs.

After: I took one final measurement, and weighed 162. However, I cannot say I "lost 4 pounds" because your weight totally depends on your water consumption at the time. All the weight I "lost" was most likely water weight. Also, keep in mind that I was trying to maintain my weight, not lose any. If I wanted to, I definitely could've knocked off some pounds.

Acne
====
Before: Pretty bad, in my opinion. I was hoping this diet would help, because maybe all the refined foods have something to do with it?

After: About the same. No significant improvement. I think all the dairy I eat on this diet has something to do with it.

Strength
========
Before: We can just call this "normal." I'm able to do bench workouts and sprinting and stuff at high intensity. I can bench around 85% of my max for probably 6 reps.

After: If I do heavy weight lifting, or try to sprint, it feels harder. I definitely die out faster. However, my strength at low intensity running / cycling and lighter weight lifting feels improved, actually. I can crank out a ton of reps of like 60% of my max bench press, but can only do like two when I get near 75-80% or higher.

Exercise
========
Before: I'm an active guy, even outside of school sports. I play spikeball, throw a football around, play soccer in my yard. I don't really get "tired."

After: Once I was past the transition stage, nothing seemed different. I didn't even think about how I felt when I played stuff like spikeball or a pickup basketball game, I just played and felt fine. It'd be interesting to see how I would do at a full on soccer game or track meet.

Headaches
=========
Before: I get pretty frequent headaches, and they are always on the right half of my head. They kinda suck and I think they are a result of dehydration, sleep deprivation, and stress.

After: I've been getting the same amount of sleep, and the stress I feel is about the same compared to when I got out of school. But I have been more hydrated. Anyway, I haven't gotten a single headache since I went keto.

Other
=====
Well, my pee and breath definitely smell different. My overall happiness and satisfactin with life is about the same, although not being able to eat delicious sugary food sometimes is a downer, but I'm used to it now. My poop schedule didn't change, but they are consistently nice and easy, whereas before sometimes they aren't too fun. If I have too much MCT oil, though, that's a different story.
