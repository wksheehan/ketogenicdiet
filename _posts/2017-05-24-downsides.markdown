Here are all the downsides to being on the ketogenic diet, atleast after my experience.

1. It's much harder to eat out, especially with friends. Going out to eat with friends is pretty common, and very frequent if you have a girlfriend / boyfriend. Most places, the entire menu is going to include some form of carbs. Breakfast places are good, but besides that, it is definitely hard. Think of Canes, for example. You can't eat anything at canes! I made it work a couple times at some restaurants, but most other times I would eat at home before I went out or brought some snacks. I recommend mighty fine, because you can get a burger in a bowl there.

2. It would be more difficult to maintain during sports, especially ones where you exert yourself a lot. I actually tried earlier this year to go on this diet during track, but that was a total no-go. Golf or maybe tennis, would be ok. But sports where you are doing a lot of running, especially high intensity running, would be very hard to do during. Not only would you lose around a week of training during the transition phase, but keeping up with your caloric intake would be a whole nother challenge. It was already hard enough to make sure I was getting enough calories when I wasn't playing a sport, imagine if I had been! That being said, a lot of ultra endurance athletes like cyclists and marathon runners are experimenting with keto and getting great results.

3. The keto flu, duh. It kind of sucks but once you get past it, you're all good, so it really isn't that bad.

4. You can't eat a lot delicious food. For example, anything that sugar is in. Well that sucks! Sugar is delicious and a lot of us crave it daily. It's addictive. Also, carbs. I love carbs. Pizza, pasta, doughnuts, bread, muffins, crackers, cereal. Carbs + sugar = yum. That's too bad. However, the good thing is that I found after about a week and a half-ish I stopped craving carbs, and even on my cheat day I didn't really want to eat carbs. After going off the diet for about a week, I still don't really crave carbs but eat them simply because they are more accesible / convenient.

5. Honestly, that's kind of it. It really isn't that bad and I think the worst part about it for most people is having to be aware of what they are eating. It is very nice being able to eat whatever you want and not having to think about it or turn the box over to pick apart the nutrition facts, or be that one guy who has dietary needs on a school trip or something.
