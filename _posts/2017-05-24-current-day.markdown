Here is what a typical day looks like for me, eating whatever I want.
=====================================================================

I wake up around 9-10 A.M (if I don't have school). I'm STARVING. Like my stomach hurts and I just can't wait to eat food. I make my usual breakfast--two eggs cooked in butter and mini bagel with butter on top--and feel better. I'm ready to start my day!

Somewhere between 11 and 12 I usually get really really hungry, and the longer I wait the worse I can function. If it's been like over 4 hours since I ate, that's all that will be on my mind. And my stomach will feel like it's caving in.

A lot of times I'll eat like a granola bar (so unhealthy) before lunch to try and settle my stomach, but it doesn't really work. When I do finally eat lunch, it's usually out at a restaurant. Unless we're talking about during school. Or if I'm at home, I'll just make myself a quesadilla or panini and maybe some chips and guac. If I'm at school, I eat a huge lunch but then still get hungry before sports.

I get pretty hungry again after about 3 hours, and have a snack. Cereal, bagel, maybe some nuts. If I'm at school I just have to push through sports practice hungry. Then I come home starving and eat a massive dinner and feel so satisfied. Then I have dessert--usually icecream or cookies or something like that. But not all the time.

If I'm at school and it's a thursday, bless up. Because there's pizza! Even though I just had a huge lunch I always try to get pizza from the school store, and when I do, I'll eat like two pizza rolls and two slices of pepperoni pizza. That usually tides me over until dinner, but I'm still hungry AF.


Here is what a typical day looks like for me on the Ketogenic Diet.
===================================================================

I wake up around 9-10 A.M. I'm not starving, but eating sounds good. I make myself two cups of butter coffee, which takes about 10 minutes total. If I am in a rush to get somewhere, I'll pour the coffee in a thermos and drink it on the go. Otherwise I just enjoy it at my dining table or as I'm walking around the house. That's it for breakfast. Since the only calories I'm consuming in the morning are coming from fat, I'm technically fasting from the previous night's dinner until lunch. And since I don't eat lunch until around 1 P.M. each day, I "fast" for around 16 hours (depending on when I ate dinner). This is really healthy for your body and helps get your body used to the metablic process of ketosis.

About 4 hours after the butter coffee, I start getting hungry again, but by no means starving. For lunch, around 1-2 P.M., I almost always make myself some eggs, avocado, and fatty meat. I fry the eggs in about half a tablespoon of butter. I eat a whole avocado, with a lot of salt. The meat is mostly bacon, sometimes sausage, sometimes leftovers. Sometimes if I'm feeling creative I'll whip up something different like an omelette with lots of cheese and the meat inside. It's nice having coffee for breakfast, and then breakfast for lunch. Because I love breakfast food. Lunch is very satisfying and will often tide me over until dinner with not much hunger in between.

Between dinner and lunch I often mindlessly snack on nuts and cheese, maybe some beef jerky. If I exercise, I eat a little more after that. But other than that I am totally good to go until dinner. I do get pretty hungry by around 6-7, but it's never too bad. I'll often be put into situations where eating carbs is an option I have, but I always have to turn it down. Costco samples, my friends want to go to Canes, the food around my house...

At dinner I usually have a big salad with tons of fatty chicken, olive oil, feta cheese, and other low carb stuff like onions or carrots or cucumbers. And of course, avocado. Delicious!

If my day had been lacking some fat, I'll make a dessert like [keto icecream](https://wksheehan.github.io/ketogenicdiet/eating#icecream). Otherwise, I'm full until bed time, even if I eat early and stay out late like at a party or something. I have been going to lots of parties lately and the temptation to eat all the delicious looking sweets and sodas isn't bad honestly, and I make it through the night having had a good time, not too tired or anything.
