Hey guys! This is my first post on my blog page. It was fairly easy to set up this website using my terminal and some [online instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/#requirements). Basically, I used Jekyll as a static site generator, and created the actual website using Github Pages. Github pages is really nice to have because it is "hosted directly from your Github repository." All I have to do to make these posts is create a new markdown document under the posts folder in my text editor Atom, save, and push up to my github repository. From there it automagically makes my changes live on the github page. It's cool too because the link has my name in it!

For those of you who don't know, markdown is a common document formatting for creating these posts. I found a good website for learning the basics of it, which have helped me to make these posts.

So far this summer I have finished the Ruby on Rails tutorial by Michael Hartl, which was very long and pretty challenging, but with the help of some of the guys at Shaka Code (Dylan and Rob) I got through it. I learned so much from it I honestly would've been satisfied if that was the whole internship. Although at this moment I could most likely not create a brand new website from scratch all on my own, the tutorial taught me a lot of the basics of Rails and I now have a good understanding of how the whole process works. I realized how complicated developing a website can be (such as security issues) but how using rails makes it easier.

I will be posting most likely once a week, keeping a log of all that I learn as I continue working with Shaka Code. I hope to add my own contributions to their new app that they are working on, in any form or fashion. Stay tuned!
