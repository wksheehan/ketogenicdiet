    That's it! You should be feeling full of energy and not even hungry for about 4 hours!
    And, you won't have a normal crash typically associated with coffee.

  <h1> Butter Coffee or Tea </h1>
  <p> 1. Brew two cups of your favorite Coffee or Tea. <br>
      2. Pour into a blender <br>
      3. Add 2 tbsp of grass fed butter to the blender <br>
      4. Add 1 tbsp of MCT Oil to the blender <br>
      5. Blend it up and serve hot or over ice! <br> <br>

      Note: You can play around with the amount of MCT Oil--I recommend
      starting small and building up to 1-1.5 tbsp
